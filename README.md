# Wiser Task Scheduler (WTS)
The Wiser Task scheduler (WTS in short) is a .net core service which can be used to run specific tasks in various time-schedules. The WTS is configured with JSON-based configuration files. These configuration files can also be read directly from a Wiser account if Wiser is in place.

## Prerequisites
[.NET Desktop runtime 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) (x64) needs to be installed on the server

## Installation of the WTS on a Windows server
0. Check the Prerequisites above
1. Build the project (**not** as single file) as described in the Build section below
2. Copy all build files to the desired folder on the server
3. Setup the Appsettings.json file (see documentation)
4. Open the command prompt (CMD) or PowerShell with administrator rights
5. Run this command: `sc.exe create "<Service name>" binpath="<Service exe location>";`<br>- change `<Service name>` with a name you prefer ('WTS Auto Updater' for example)<br>- change `<Service exe location>` to the location of the .exe file (for example: 'c:\WTSAutoUpdater\autoupdater.exe')
6. Open the services panel in Windows (you can run 'msc' via the Start menu)
7. Find the newly created service and open its properties
8. Change the startup type to 'automatic (delayed start)'
9. Start the service
10. Wait untill the service is started
11. check the log files for a succesfull startup

## Installation of the auto updater (optional)
The auto updater is a tool embedded into the WTS project to automatically update the WTS whenever there is a new release. This can come in handy if you have multiple servers running the WTS. Only if something has gone wrong or there is a newer version with breaking changes is a notification given because a manual action is required. Updates take place at midnight, local server time. In order for this to work the auto updater also needs to be installed on the server. Follow the steps below (these steps are almost the same as the steps above, only the name and location of this service are difzferent);

## Manual updating the WTS
If the auto updater is not used or if the auto updater has indicated that a manual action is required, the steps below can be followed to update the WTS to a new version:
1. Create a new build according to section "Create new build";
2. Open the task manager and go to the services tab;
3. Find the service and stop it;
4. Copy all published files (excluding appsettings) to the desired server/folder;
5. Start the service;
6. Wait until it is set to active 
7. check the logs to see if it started correctly.

## De-installing the service (WTS and/or Auto Updater)
1. Open the command prompt (CMD) or PowerShell with administrator rights
2. Run this command: `sc.exe delete "<Service naam>"`<br>- change `<Service name>` with the correct name of the service
3. If you want to completely remove the WTS or the Auto Updater then also remove the files from the server 

## Creating a new (release) build
1. **Only at release**: open `WiserTaskScheduler.csproj` in a text editor and increase the version number at "Version", "AssemblyVersion" and "FileVersion";
2. Start the project in favorite sde (preferably 'Jetbrains Rider');
3. Right click on the project and click "Publish";
4. Click "Publish WiserTaskScheduler to folder" or "Publish AutoUpdater to folder" (depending on which project to create a new build);
5. The application will be published in the project folder "bin\Release\net7.0\win-x64\publish\";
6. Check that all DLL files are present in the publish folder, about 400 files should be present. If these are missing, the application is built as a "Single file" and cannot be started.
7. **Only at release**: Place all files **EXCLUDING** appsettings in a zip file called "Update.zip" and place it in the "Update" folder;
8. **Only at release**: Update the "version.json" file in the "Update" folder;
9. **Only at release**: Merge to main.
